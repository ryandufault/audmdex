**audmdex** is a lightweight, browser-based tool for quickly inspecting audio metadata.  
  
available at [**ryandufault.github.io/audmdex**](https://ryandufault.github.io/audmdex/)

## How It Works

1. Upload an audio file.
2. `music-metadata-browser` parses the file directly in the browser.
3. Metadata is displayed in a clean, readable format.
4. Reload or close the page and all data is gone.


## Features

* #### Client-side only  
  All file handling and metadata extraction happens entirely in your browser.  
  Your audio files are **never uploaded**, stored, or sent to any server.

* #### Fast, reliable metadata extraction  
  Powered by [`music-metadata-browser`](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata-browser), a robust library built for safe in-browser analysis.

* #### Privacy-first   
  No ads, no tracking scripts, no analytics.  
  Everything is processed in temporary memory and disappears the moment you close or refresh the page.

* #### Simple & universal  
  Works anywhere a modern browser runs. Just open the page, drop an audio file, and get structured metadata instantly.
